# Intrusion Detection using Machine Learning 🛡️

🔒🚀This repository houses a comprehensive Intrusion Detection System (IDS) project built on machine learning techniques, with a primary focus on the NSL-KDD dataset. Our goal is to develop a robust, scalable, and efficient system to detect and prevent intrusions in computer networks.


## Overview

This project focuses on building an Intrusion Detection System using machine learning models. The primary goal is to safeguard computer networks against various forms of cyber threats and malicious activities.


## Dataset

📂 The NSL-KDD dataset was used for training and evaluating the models. The NSL-KDD dataset is a well-known benchmark dataset for intrusion detection, containing a large number of network traffic instances categorized into normal and attack classes.

Dataset source: [NSL-KDD Dataset](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/nsl.html)


## Models

🔍 Three machine learning models were implemented in this project:

1. **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**: A recurrent neural network model designed to handle sequential data for intrusion detection.

2. **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)**: A deep learning model typically used for image processing, adapted to detect intrusions by processing network traffic data.
   
4. **FDNN (Feedforward Neural Network)**: A feedforward neural network is a type of artificial neural network where data flows in one direction, from input layer to output layer, without loops or feedback connections.

- Some basic models where also implemented to see how they perform and vary from the neural networks
  
5. **Gaussian Naive Bayes**: It's a probabilistic classifier based on the Bayes' theorem and assumes that features are conditionally independent. It's simple and efficient, often used for text classification and spam detection.

6. **Logistic Regression**: It models the probability that a given input belongs to one of the two classes using the logistic function. It's a linear model and works well for problems with linearly separable classes.

7. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: It classifies data points based on the majority class of their k-nearest neighbors. KNN is a non-parametric and instance-based classifier.

8. **Decision Tree Classifier**: It partitions the feature space into regions and assigns a class label to each region. Decision trees can model complex relationships in the data but are prone to overfitting.

9. **Random Forest Classifier**: It's an ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy and reduce overfitting. Random Forest is highly versatile and effective for a wide range of binary classification tasks.


## Model Performances
